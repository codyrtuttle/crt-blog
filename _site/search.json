This is mainly a place for me to explore data that interests me in a way that’s easy for people to follow along with. Most of the time, the data I go through will be related to policy topics that I care about and have some experience with, primarily social and economic policy, poverty, health, housing, banking and credit, criminal justice, etc. But I also love to dive into new areas, so I hope to explore some budding areas of interest like machine learning, interactive web graphics, and sports analytics.\nDuring summer of 2019 I kept another blog for a short while that was basically the same thing that I do here. You can find my old posts here. I decided that I wanted to make a more professional looking website that I could more easily customize and integrate into my normal workflow, which is why you find yourself where you do. If you have any interest in making a similar style website, I recommend using this post from Tom Mock on using the distill R package and Netlify to host a blog - I basically followed it step by step to build this site.\n**\nIn my day job, I work as a research scientist at Minnesota Management and Budget, where I focus on impact evaluation, human services, and social policy. I graduated with my Master of Public Policy from the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota in May 2020 with a concentration in quantitative policy analysis and social policy. Before that I got a BA and MA in Sociology from the University of Arkansas where I studied criminology and wrote a thesis about how the news media frames issues of immigration and crime (if you’re interested, you can find an article I published from it in Sociological Spectrum here).\nI live in Minneapolis, MN with my beyond-incredible wife, Mariana. When I’m not doing data and policy stuff, I love to hang out with Mariana, run, kayak, ice skate, hike, bake sourdough, garden, read, and write poetry. I’m a sucker for a good IPA, bourbon, or Scotch, and I will always inhale popcorn when it’s in front of me. Thanks for visiting my site!\n\n\n\n",
