This will be another short post with no code, but I wanted to plug the new musings style blog that I made! At this point, it was a way to get some experience creating a blog with Quarto, but I envision being a supplement to this primary site with shorter posts, not necessarily with code, and not necessarily long or well thought-through. Just a way to write more and hopefully get more content out there. Anyways, the new blog is [here](https://crt-musings.netlify.app/) - go check it out! I also linked to it on the nav bar from this main site.
